# amoseman1.github.io

I created this site to work on my semantic HTML formatting.

I cleaned up the redundancies in the CSS code.

I debugged the 'Search Engine Optimization' link on the website so it functioned properly.

There are comments added to the CSS and HTML files to show the changes made.
