I renamed the element tags in the HTML to work on my semantic formatting, then changed the relavent CSS properties.

I cleaned up the redundancies in the CSS code.

I debugged the 'Search Engine Optimization' link on the website so it functioned properly.

There are comments added to the CSS and HTML files to show the changes made.
